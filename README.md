# Book Search API overview

This mock/sample API simulates endpoints commonly used in catalog/archival type web applications, and includes endpoints that Create, retrieve, update, and delete resources.

## About This API

I created this mock API for learning and demonstration purposes. It's called the Book Search API, and it was created by an online catalog company called Bookish. Bookish is where people who love to read go to love, hate, and discover books.

## Purpose

This project is part of my technical writing portfolio, and aims to demonstrates my ability to:

- Write and design clear, structured, and helpful developer-focused API documentation as a         technical writer.
- Read and interpret public API behavior.
- Learn how to use new tools and the OpenAPI standard.

## What is in this Repository?

- Conceptual API documentation in Markdown format.
- An OpenAPI (Swagger) specification in YAML format.
- Sample requests and responses in JSON format.
- This README.md that explains the API project.

## Tools used

- Swagger Editor
- Postman (for creating mock servers and mock response bodies)
